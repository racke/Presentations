Debian and Perl

Vital parts of the Debian packaging system like Debconf or debhelper 
are written in Perl, which is a widely use programming language with
the most extensive set of modules provided by the CPAN network.

This talk discusses the Perl infrastructure in Debian, 
pro and cons of using Debian as a platform for Perl applications
and explains methods to create Debian packages from Perl modules 
and applications. 

Finally a couple of practical issues are presented, including:

* Apache2/mod_perl on Sarge
* Interchange and threaded Perl
* Using Perl in maintainer scripts
