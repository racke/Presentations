Request Tracker (RT) is an enterprise-grade ticketing system which enables a group of people to intelligently and efficiently manage tasks, issues, and requests submitted by a community of users.

RT is also known to be flexible and extensible, allowing for local customizations without changing the original files.

The presentation focuses on customizing RT with plugins, remote access through the REST interface and a preview of RT 4.0.

Extensions have now a formalized interface in 3.8 and are called plugins. They hook into in the web interface and/or the mail gateway. The talk describes the installation and configuration of plugins in general and takes a closer look on
several existing plugins:

RTx::Calendar
RT::Authen::ExternalAuth
RTx::Email::Completion
RT::Extension::EmailByCommand
RT::Extension::ExtractCustomFieldValues

Other ways to cleanly customize RT are callbacks, overlays and custom fields.

The recommended method for external access to the RT objects is the REST interface. It allows manipulation of tickets by using the same credentials as for the web interface.

RT::Client::REST provides an easier programming interface to deal with the REST interface. As demonstration a ticket will be generated per talk in the YAPC::EU::2009 schedule during the presentation.

For RT 4 the developers are doing a complete overhaul of the codebase, replacing the homegrown application framework with Jifty, adding a few major features and redesigning thinks like Scrips, and Date/Time implementation.
