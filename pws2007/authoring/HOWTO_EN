	 ====================================================

		 How to start your own LaTeX article



- Copy the whole directory "somewhere"; 
  this copy will become the new working directory


- Change into that working directory


- Rename the subdir "sts72"
  e.g. into "maxe68"
  (choose an author specific mnemonic that
  probably doesn't collide with other authors)


- If you provide more than one article, create an own working
  directory for each one and choose distinguishing AUTHORMNEMONICs,
  for instance "maxe68a", "maxe68b", "maxe68c", ...


- Rename the file "article_sts72.tex" into "article_maxe68.tex".


- In file "main.tex" change the line

    \input{article_sts72.tex}

  into

    \input{article_maxe68.tex}



- In file "article_maxe68.tex" do the following string substitution:

    sts72  ->  maxe68


- In Makefile change the line

    AUTHOR_ID = sts72

  into

    AUTHOR_ID = maxe68



- Change content of "article_maxe68.tex" as you like, it's now your
  article.


- Please provide one section "\subsection*{Author}", in which all
  authors of the article are listed in single lines.


- Provide a section "\subsection*{Bio Your Name}" with a short
  biography of that author. Use more such sections for more authors.


- Please provide one section "\subsection*{Abstract}" with a short
  abstract without further sub headlines.


- Test it. Either via "make" oder manuelly via these commands:

    $ latex main.tex
    $ makeindex -s main.ist main.idx
    $ latex main.tex
    $ latex main.tex
    $ dvipdf main.dvi


- In case of latex errors due to missing packages, that we expect in
  "perlws.sty", but that you don't need, feel free to comment out the
  corresponding \usepackage lines (use '%' at beginning of a line).
  Most often this happens to the "listings" package which isn't
  available in each system.


- Keywords of your talk that are not marked either in the abstract or
  in the article can be provided in an optional "indexlist_maxe68"
  file. Each word in a single line.


- In case you want provide optional goodies for the CD, please copy
  them into a subdir named "goodies_maxe68/". This directory will be
  made part of the CD.  A file "index.html" can be provided as an entry
  point, otherwise a link to the directory will be made. 


- Please send an early version of the file "article_maxe68.tex"
  together with the subdirectory "maxe68" to the proceedings team
  or your designated sponsor (tutor).

  team at:

Have fun!
