		=====================================
		Proceedings paper German Perlworkshop
                                  -
			  LaTeX environment
		=====================================


* This subdirectory is a development environment in which LaTeX
  articles for the German Perlworkshop can be created.


* After all we need the file "article_AUTHORMNEMONIC.tex" and, where
  appropriate, additional includes (e.g., images) in a sub directory
  named AUTHORMNEMONIC/. Everything else is just support for the
  authors.
  "make mydist" should create a zip with all needed files.


* The file HOWTO_EN describes how to start.


* The files "main.tex" and "perlws.sty" simulate our final LaTeX
  environment for the proceedings paper. Your Artikel must work within
  the main.tex-context. The Makefile contains every needed steps
  toward a complete proceedings paper.


* The file "article_sts72.tex" is an example article that should be
  used as a template. Before you change it you must change the
  AUTHORMNEMONIC (currently sts72). See HOWTO_EN for a detailed
  description.


* In case you provide more than one article, please submit them
  completely independent with distinguishing AUTHORMNEMONICs,
  e.g., use sts72a, sts72b, sts72c, ...


* There are example projects for other formats beside LaTeX
  (PerlPoint, POD), see hints for authors at "www.perl-workshop.de".


* Any questions? Just email to the friendly workshop organization team:

Have fun!
