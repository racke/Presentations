real cow instead of can of worms

(Actually, a lot of my code uses DBIx::Class, which is a whole can of worms, but I still recommend it if you're doing significant amounts of database access in Perl. It's a lot cleaner than embedding SQL into Perl directly.)

Nice stuff:
   Chaining, pass around resultsets + executing at the latest moment
   Examples for extra methods
      (predefined searches)
   Tracing
   Extra relationships
