Title:

    DBIx::Class - Can of Worms || Best Thing Since Sliced Bread

Summary:

DBIx::Class is both a very useful tool for applications using SQL
databases and an intimidating piece of software.

You can find comprehensive documentation about DBIx::Class on
CPAN, but it is not easy to find the stuff that makes it the
best thing since sliced bread.

In this talk we brush through the rough edges of DBIx::Class
and look how they can be alleviated with goodies like Candy,
Helpers and other amazing add-ons for DBIx::Class.

Also I will make a case why using DBIx::Class is a splendid idea,
for example getting rid of embedded SQL, painless database
upgrades and keeping the business logic outside of your main
applications.
