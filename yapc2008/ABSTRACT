Interchange is a mature open source online shop platform constantly developed since 1995. Perl as implementation language allows Interchange to be a robust, secure and very flexible application.

This talk starts with an introduction on the architecture and capabilities of Interchange.

It continues with a detailed description how the beauty of Perl helped
to evolve Interchange into a software which drives high traffic
e-commerce sites.
 
Practical programming examples and an overview about new developments
in Interchange will be at the end of the talk.
