Funktionsweise

     The  daemon  listens  for incoming connections on Unix or TCP socket and scans files or directories on demand. It's a part of the Clam AntiVirus package. It
       reads its configuration information from a clamd.conf file. It provides on-access scanning feature (clamuko) under Linux.

Commands

     PING   Check the server's state. It should reply with "PONG".

       VERSION
              Print a version information.

       RELOAD Reload the virus databases.

       QUIT   Perform a clean exit.

       SCAN file/directory
              Scan a file or a directory (recursively) with archive support enabled (if not disabled in clamd.conf). A full path is required.

       RAWSCAN file/directory
              Scan a file or directory (recursively) with archive support disabled. A full path is required.

       CONTSCAN file/directory
              Scan a file or directory (recursively) with archive support enabled and continue scanning even when virus is found. A full path is required.
