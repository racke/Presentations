Dancer and DBIx::Class

Body:

DBIx::Class is certainly one of the greatest treasures of "Modern Perl" and features fast and convenient database queries.

Dancer makes it really easy to build web applications by using a simple syntax and straightforward programming.

How do they fit together? First with the DBIC plugin for Dancer.
This allows you to use multiple DBIx::Class schemas within a
single Dancer application.

I also wrote a Dancer session engine based on DBIC, which allows you to save sessions into the database.

Finally, a project is presented that lets you edit database contents based on a DBIx::Class schema.
