Template::Zoom - Modern HTML and PDF Engine

Template::Zoom enables you to completely separate web design and programming
tasks for dynamic web applications. 

Templates are plain HTML files without inline code or mini language, thus
making it easy to maintain them for web designers and to preview them with
a browser.

The CSS selectors in the template are tied to your data structures or
objects by a specification, which relieves the programmer from changing
his code for mere changes of class names.

In addition to HTML output, Template::Zoom also supports generation of
PDF files on-the-fly based on the same template and specification.
