Monitoring with Nagios and check_mk

Monitoring is essential to ensure the integrity of your production systems.
Lots of things can go wrong which you wouldn't notice otherwise. Disks
fill up to the brim, ordering in your online shop doesn't work anymore or
data exchange with other systems ceases to function. All of these result
in money lost, upset employers and customers going to the competition.
