Dancer Academy - From Zero to Hero

Dancer, one of the web frameworks written in Perl, became quite
popular despite it's relatively young age. It is simple to start 
with, yet powerful enough to run larger web applications.

Aside from being easy and straightforward, Dancer is really
flexible. The plugin ecosystem provides features for your
web application without further ado. Hooks allow you to
extend existing functionality without changing someone's else
code. On top of that you can pick your session, template and logging
engine from a number of alternatives.

This presentation teaches you first the basic steps of dancing
like adding routes, building your templates and using plugins.
To make you more sure-footed on the dance-floor, the next
topics are hooks, error handling, logging and Dancer scripts.
Finally, typical Dancer deployments and a sneak preview about
Dancer 2 finish up our Dancer Academy.
